This repository holds the source and project files of my personal website that I built to showcase myself. The website informs who am I, what I do, showcases my portfolio and also includes a contact form. The website is live at [nunoarruda.com](https://nunoarruda.com/).

## How to use

Check [Dopefolio](https://github.com/rammcodes/Dopefolio) to learn how to run this project. I personally use `python3 -m http.server` (on macOS) to quickly spin up a local server and `npx firebase deploy --only hosting` for deployment.
